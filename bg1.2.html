                I have been working on developing a Supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system involving autonomous drone solutions 
                to provide wind farm operators with constant eyes in the sky with high frequency autonomous inspections along a predetermined flight path around the wind farm. 
                This ensures a steady availability of the digitalised wind turbine data and limits the health and safety risk of carrying out manual rope inspections on windmill turbines. 


            </p>

            <p class="row mb-4">

                Right now, installing SCADA systems such as these  capable of acquiring constant and reliable data about the structural health of wind turbines can be strategically used 
                to train algorithms capable of predicting when turbine maintenance needs to be scheduled. 
                This in turn would greatly reduce the cost of unscheduled maintenance on wind turbines and decrease long-term failures.
