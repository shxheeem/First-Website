                O&M or operation and maintenance of windmill farms both offshore and onshore is an industry thatâ€™s not just seen rapid growth but also demands huge amounts of innovation to meet the ever-increasing maintenance demands of our windmill farms.
                But the global offshore wind O&M market is still young and lacks experience in long-term O&M issues and failures. Currently, only 1.8 gigawatts (GW) of global capacity have been operating for over 10 years.
                By 2029,  90% of the operational fleet, equivalent to 165 GW will still be under 10 years old.

            <p class="row mb-5">
                Traditional O&M strategies heavily depend upon trained technicians and or systems that are not capable of inspecting windmill blades quickly and accurately. 
                This does not provide grid operators with an efficient way  to inspect blades and collect data. 
                Tackling the problem of collecting reliable data on the health of windmill blades would put grid operators in a position to analyse and accurately plan out maintenance to maximise profitability and minimise windmill downtime.  
                O&M costs are known to account for up to 30% of the price of energy produced by offshore wind farms so reducing the maintenance costs would inevitably mean greater competitiveness of electricity generated by offshore wind turbines in the electricity market. 
                This hopefully leads to an even stronger adaptation of windmill energy by the industry
