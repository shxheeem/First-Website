                The main challenges I’ve come across during my initial research is collecting accurate,  reliable and moderately sized  data about windmill surface  faults and cracks  in order to train a model to detect cracks on windmill surfaces.  
                Such data is often protected information and is not readily available to the public. 
                I’ve also found companies on track to develop and implement very similar solutions, notably, the Lilypad project by Marshall Aerospace. 
                They have been successful in securing key partners for developing both their drone hardware capability and also the software requirements to build such a project.
